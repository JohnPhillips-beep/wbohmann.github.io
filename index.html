  <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
    <p>At the core, I am a pure constructivist.  I believe that new learning builds on prior knowledge.  
  We remember that which we experience, the events we make connections to and are engaged in.  
  Real learning is not just in the telling and doing.  Deep learning comes from recalling and reflecting.  
  I believe we make meaning from the environment around us.  It is imperative that educators set up that 
  environment for success to facilitate deep connections.</p>
